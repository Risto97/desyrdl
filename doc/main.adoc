= rdltovhdl

== Concept

* You compile a set of SystemRDL files with a Python script based on systemrdl-compiler.

=== Templates

* Put as much information from the compiled SystemRDL tree into a VHDL pkg file as possible. This way the actual HDL entities stay more or less away from template processing.
